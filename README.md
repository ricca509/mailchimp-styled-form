# What is it?

This is my attempt to custom-style and then serve the html and css for
a mailchimp embedded form.

## What's special about it?

Nothing, really. I am serving the form so that I can make changes in a single place and have all my forms updated. To do this, I use `document.write` inside an IIFE to serve the file as a JavaScript resource.

## How is it served?

I use [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/) to serve this files from GitHub.
